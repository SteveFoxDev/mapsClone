# Maps Clone

This app was built using VITE, React, Typescript. It is part of an online course by Stephen Grider on Udemy. It is a basic Map, type in a location and it returns a list of suggested locations based on your input.  Select "Go" and the map moves to the location selected. This app uses openStreetMap and Leaflet.  I plan on optimizing this app at a later date.  Issues I have had are getting the Marker Icons to display after running build and deploying.  The workaround I have found to work is to move the marker icons from leaflet dist/ into the assets/images folder after running build.

To Do
- Create "Search" Button 
- Add styling
